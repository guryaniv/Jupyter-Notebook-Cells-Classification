# Jupyter Notebook Cells Classification

Our task is to classify Jupyter notebook cells into the relevant Data-Science workflow stage, as described in the documentation-
@NEED TO ADD DOCUMENTATION LINK

The first notebook is "Exploration_and_WeakSupervision.ipynb" and as the name implies it contains our data exploration and tagging using snorkel weak supervision. It will automatically open the second notebook, that contains our end-classification-model (LSTM).

*If you are only intrested in the end-model you may start with the second notebook "Classifier.ipynb"*

**Note** - snorkel.db, LSTM.h5 and the checkpoints folder enable you to load already existing database and trained model and skip long executions. Follow the instructions in the notebooks.
