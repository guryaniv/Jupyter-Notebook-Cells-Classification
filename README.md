# Jupyter-Notebook-Cells-Classification

Note - the file snorkel.db, LSTM.h5 and checkpoints folder are saved data which used to skip long execution from scratch (model training and database querying).

To start open "Exploration_and_WeakSupervision.ipynb" and follow instructions (it will automatically open the 2nd notebook).
If you are only intrested in the end-model (LSTM network) you may start by the 2nd notebook "Classifier.ipynb"
